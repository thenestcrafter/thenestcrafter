<a id="about-us" class="anchor" href="#about-us" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Housing cost and curse of bank loan</h2>

   <p>  
    Premium housing in Bangalore has been all over 75-80 lacs. A middle class can not even dream about it. If a we were to search an economical and and affordable property nothing can be found is below 50 lacs. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Say if we were lucky to find one house for 30 lacs,the next problem is do we have  <strong>All the money</strong> to buy that house? <strong>of course no</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p> We  will need to go for bank loan.  Will bank give us loan without their benefit? <strong>of course no.</strong> </p>

    <p>They would charge interest. In India interest rates are pretty high approx 9-10%. For a loan tenure period of 15-20 years you may end up paying the double amount. <strong><a id="illa"  href="https://emicalculator.net/" >EMI calculator</a></strong> to help you with calculation. 
    </p>  

    <p>
    Gaurav Sharma was lucky to find a very good 2 BHK house for about 40 lacs back in 2007, <strong>borrowed 38 lacks</strong> of loan from a private bank, It's been 10 years, he has been paying approx 4.5 lacs every year, so he <strong>already paid 45 lacs</strong> to bank, remember he borrowed the loan only for 38 lacs, and guess what's balance amount?  still <strong>25+ lacs loan still need to be paid</strong>.</p>

<a id="about-us" class="anchor" href="#about-us" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The ray of hope</h2>

   <p>Good news is if you are looking for affordable housing that too without bank loan, it has now become possible in Bangalore.
    A 2 BHK house would approximately cost say 30 lacs with all those amenities which you would have desired. </p> 

   <p>Here is the gist of this novel scheme - Meet the people, understand the project details, take your own time to research if you like it, come back and book with 2 lacs Rs booking amount. Within 4 months pay a minimum of 35% upfront of the total cost and balance in maximum 48 EMI’s (Interest FREE) which is <em>Four Years</em>. For example, if the total cost of a flat is 30 lakhs, then you pay 10.50 lakhs (35%) minimum upfront payment and the balance 19.50 lakhs in maximum 48 <strong>Interest FREE</strong> EMI’s of approximately <strong>Rs.40,625/-</strong> each.</p>

   <p>We are sure that sounds unbelievable in today's world, and the first thought that comes to mind is this must bee some fraud scheme or some sort of trap. 
      We wouldn't blame you to think that way, before you 130+ people also did not believe until they met us, interviewed us, saw our existing projects, 
      heard from us? how are we able to do it in this price? If you also similar questions want to interview us fill the inquiry form and we can seat over a coffee and explain you the vision, history, completed and ongoing projects, business model etc. everything.
