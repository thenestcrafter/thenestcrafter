  "body": "<b>Bismillahir Rahmaanir Raheem</b> - _In the Name of Allah the Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful_!!\r\n\r\n## About Us\r\n\r\nIf there is a will there are multiple ways. Owning a decent flat in metropolitan cities of India through Halal means is no longer a distant dream. After so many years of patient waiting, contemplation and ground work, we are finally able to arrive at launching housing projects under the banner of **Halal Housing** - a novel housing scheme for the truly faithful. It is a hard reality that many of our brothers and sisters are still not in a position to have a own house in spite of a decent earning for the simple reason that they don’t want to go against the tenets of Islam by taking a conventional home loan from a Bank and fall into the traps of paying interest for the rest of their lives. **Halal Housing** is the result of their patient waiting and putting their complete trust in Allah. \r\n\r\n_Alhamdulillah_, under this scheme we have already completed one project in Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore and we are just starting our next project in the same vicinity but in a much bigger area. Our mission is to create more and more such projects, that will make housing affordable, simple and enjoyable. \r\n\r\nHere is the gist of this novel scheme - Pay a minimum of 35% upfront of the total cost and balance in maximum 36 EMI’s (Interest FREE) which is _Three Years_. For example, if the total cost of a flat is 30 lakhs, then you pay 10.5 lakhs (35%) minimum upfront payment and the balance 19.5 lakhs in maximum 36 EMI’s of approximately **Rs.55,000/-** each. We are sure this sounds very attractive and irresistible, _Alhamdulillah_.\r\n\r\n## Project Summary\r\n\r\nSummary | Details\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nProject Name | **Dar-e-Salaam**, second project under the Halal Housing Scheme\r\nLocation | Central Excise Layout, Dodda Kammanahalli, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore\r\nNo. of Flats | 13 flats, Car Parking in the Stilt, 3 flats per floor * four floors.
